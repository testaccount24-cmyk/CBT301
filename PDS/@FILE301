//***FILE 301 is from Mike Cleary of IBM Global Services in         *   FILE 301
//*           California, and contains a version of the CDSCB       *   FILE 301
//*           (change the DSCB) TSO command processor program       *   FILE 301
//*           from File 300, which uses SAF for its security        *   FILE 301
//*           checking.  In order to be able to change              *   FILE 301
//*           attributes of a dataset, you have to have ALTER       *   FILE 301
//*           access to it, the way this command is written.  Of    *   FILE 301
//*           course, if your shop has different requirements,      *   FILE 301
//*           you can change the code, but this version shows       *   FILE 301
//*           you how to fit the RACF or SAF checking in.           *   FILE 301

//*           I have deliberately left the other CDSCB code in      *   FILE 301
//*           File 300, unchanged, because some people still want   *   FILE 301
//*           to grant authorization by hard-coded userid, and      *   FILE 301
//*           if you're so authorized, permit alteration of all     *   FILE 301
//*           datasets.  (SG 11/97)                                 *   FILE 301
